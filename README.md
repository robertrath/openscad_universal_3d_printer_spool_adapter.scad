Universal 3D Printer Spool Adapter

This universal design adapts a filament supplier's spool to a 3d printer's spool holder.

Initially I created two entries adapting HobbyKing and Mamorubot spools to a Cocoon Create Touch or Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus spool holder.

As I am expecting to use spools from other filament suppliers and the list of combinations of dimensions to increase I have created an indexed list of parameters which can grow over time in this one design.

If you want to bypass the indexing and just enter your own parameters while experimenting then simply edit the section 'Assign adapter parameters' below. If you do so please message me your new adapter combination and I will add it to the index.

To use this for an existing adapter combination,edit the section 'Uncomment One Adapter In the Following Set To Render' below so that only one entry for 'Adpater' is given.

The current list of spool to 3D printer spool holder combinations includes:

HobbyKing PETG to Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus;
Mamorubot PETG to Wanhao Duplicator i3 Plus;
